# BLAZAR
"BLAck hole Zeroes and Roots"
A tool for localizing zero sets of functions in arbitrary dimensions. Built specifically to locate horizons for black holes.

## Current Functionality
This program can solve for the zero sets of functions of arbitrary dimension (most commonly for f:R->R and g:R^2->R) and precision, and integrate sets of field equations with arbitrary precision.



## Requirements
The following is a list of third party libraries required to build and run this program.
- Boost libraries (program options, multiprecision)
- OpenGL (+ glut)

## Basic building and running
Invoke the makefile 
`make`
Run with
`./run`

## Setting up the program 
Will write this later...
